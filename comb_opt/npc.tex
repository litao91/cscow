    \item[Decision Problem] A problem whose answer is \textbf{yes} or
        \textbf{no}, if decision problem can be answered in poly time,
        then a optimal solution can be found with a few decision problem
        by binary search.
    \item[P]  Class of decision problems that can be solved in polynomial
        time. 
    \item[NP] Class of problem for which there is a ``Yes certification'',
        that is, for a yes instance, there exists a short certification
        that the answer is yes. (Given a TSP path that less than $K$, we
        know that there exist a path less than $K$, however, given a path
        greater than $K$, we don't no the answer is no in poly time).
    \item[Co-NP] Class of problem for which there is a no-certificate.
        That is for no-instances a short proof/certificate that the answer
        is no. (The complement of the problem is NP).
    \item[NP Complete] Class of decision problem for which the following
        properties hold:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The problem is in the class NP
            \item If you could  solve the problem in polynomial time, then
                all the problem in NP can be solved in polynomial time.
        \end{itemize}
    \item[Well Characterized] Problem that has both YES and NO
        certificate.
\end{description}

Problems that are well-characterized typically have an associated min-max
relation.
